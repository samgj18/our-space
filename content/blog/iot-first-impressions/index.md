First time I heard the term Internet of things, the image that got into my mind was [KITT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dANY3uk7lxc)... Please, don't ask why 😄

As you might know by now, I'm making a software engineer _"crash course"_. There I was asked to do a **technical** post about IoT, but...

So I figured out to write a technicalish post, in my own terms.

### What is IoT in the fisrt place?

> [The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)

If you're like me, you stared at the screen and thought _I have the exact same knowledge on the subject as a minute ago_.

A few years ago, when I was in high-school (not so long ago), believe it or not a was a good soccer player. I didn't trust my teammates that much, I use to think that my ability was enough. Our PE teacher invited a school to play a friendly match... they beated us. Not once, but repeatedly.

Quickly realized that my talent alone wasn't enough. I won't say that we had that classic American story where the main character succeds, we didn't, not even once. What I can say is that as small as it sounds it helped me to understand the power of being humble and relying on your colleagues.
But What does it have to do with IoT?, well imagine a single humidity sensor collecting data by his own in a hidden corner on the world, let's assume it never fails, is the best at his job and the only one doing it.

<h5>With this example a few questions come to mind.</h5>

- 🤔 **Will the data be enough?**
- 😐 **What if the sensor fails**
- 😮 **Can I measure a new variable other than humidity?**
- 🤯 **What relation exists between the temperature, the pressure and other variables?**

The answer to these questions are either **no**, **you can't** or **you will never know**. And that is simply because the data that you can get from one sensor is not enough to make accurate correlations of all the variables that converge to explain the complexity of our real world.

And that is when IoT comes to play, let's pretend that we give that sensor a unique ID and connect it to more devices, all of them transfering data over a network. Include them all, your laptop, phone, sensors... And let's be greedy, include that guy with a heart monitor
implant, and that cow with the geolocation chip. Now you get the idea, IoT is about connecting all those apparently unrelated devices in order to get data from them and try to explain if there's any relation at all.

> [Pretty much any physical object can be transformed into an IoT device if it can be connected to the internet to be controlled or communicate information.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-the-internet-of-things-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-iot-right-now/)

This ability to connect pretty much any "connectable" device has given a huge advantage to organizations, industries, cities and our lives. It has helped on process automation, analytics, on extracting valuable insights that were not available before in order to make accurate decisions.

#### Why now? If sensors have been around since the 70's and the [internet since the 60's](https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet#:~:text=The%20first%20workable%20prototype%20of,communicate%20on%20a%20single%20network.)

- You and I have access to them at not cost, nobody is a greater provider of [information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84gTofMPz1k). Nowadays we're capable of both providing information and creating systems to collect it.

- We have colossal cloud computating platforms capable of storing, processing, and managing that data.

- We have AI, now more than ever capable of great things ([Open AI](https://openai.com/)).

All these components have made possible the exponential growth of IoT.

After all of this, the two things I can think of are **how will 5G tech affect IoT?** and **where the heck is my personal information right now?**. But these questions will be a topic for upcoming posts, subscribe and stay tuned.

## Hi

##### Glad you're here.

I don’t know how you got here, but I’m glad you did. My name is Samuel, currently, SWE @[Torre](https://torre.co), based in [Barranquilla](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&ll=10.988674000000001%2C-74.80513599999999&spn=0.16818%2C0.290108&mid=1D0SdQ0ptO4GByAuyN9qfBbtO8vQ&z=12), Colombia. I also happen to be an Electronic Engineer from the [Universidad del Norte](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/)⚡️.
This little corner on the internet is about the things that I love the most... programming and [**reading**](https://lavozdelmuro.net/100-libros-que-todo-ser-humano-deberia-leer/). My motivation behind this blog is not getting famous but showing you a little bit of me and connecting with you. That’s why there’s a newsletter. Feel free to subscribe and answer (I won’t send you any spam, I hate it too). Hope you all are having a calm and restful day. See you.

## Hi

##### Glad you're here.

I don't know how you got here but I'm happy you are. My name is Samuel, currently a student of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/co) in [Barranquilla](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&ll=10.988674000000001%2C-74.80513599999999&spn=0.16818%2C0.290108&mid=1D0SdQ0ptO4GByAuyN9qfBbtO8vQ&z=12), Colombia. Studied Electronic Engineering at [U. del Norte](https://www.uninorte.edu.co/).
This little corner on the internet is about the things that I love the most, programming and [**reading**](https://lavozdelmuro.net/100-libros-que-todo-ser-humano-deberia-leer/). My motivation behind this blog is not getting famous at allüòÅ, but showing you a little bit of me, and connect with you. That's why there's a newsletter. Feel free to subscribe and answer also(I won't send you any spam, I hated to).
Hope you all be having a calm and restful day, see you.

I find myself amused by how well written and easy to understand the **'Hands on machine learning'** book is. [Aurélien Géron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aurelien-geron/) made quite a job bringing what seemed to be reserved knowledge within everyone's reach.

At the end of every chapter there is a questionnaire that helps to beef up everything you just read, in order not only to strengthen knowledge but also to share it, I've decide to answer those questions publicly in a series that I'll call 'Learning with Geron'.

## So, what is machine learning?

Arthur Samuel defined Machine Learning as:

> The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. —[Arthur Samuel](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/thinkers/Samuel.html), 1959

There are many types of problems where ML is really useful, for example, deciding weather an email is spam or not, recommending movies in your favorite streaming platform, but in essence there are four particular real world problems where ML shines:

- Problems for which existing solutions require a granular tuning or long lists of rules _(The way Google provides results deppending on your location)_.
- Complex problems for which using a traditional approach don't offer any good solution _([Machine Learning in Genomics](https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/machine-learning-in-genomics-applications/))_.
- Fluctuating environments _(Cryptocurrency is a very good example)_.
- Getting insights or useful about complex problems or large amounts of data _(Division of the clientele into groups depending on unknown similarities)_.

There are different types of Machine Learning systems, that's why they're categorized, from Supervised or Unsupervised Learning up to Instance-based or Model-based Learning.

![Machine Learning Categories](./ML.svg)

Labeled data is data that has the desired solution, for example, you want to create a model that predicts the price of houses in a particular area. To do so you need examples of houses with their respective prices and attributes.

\*_The most common tasks Supervised Learning has are:_

- Classification: Deciding if a person is most likely to have diabetes or not according to his eating habbits.
- Regression (Targeting numeric values): Predicting the price of a product based of previous prices and the characteristics of that product.

**In the other hand the most common tasks of Unsupervised Learning are:**

- Clustering: Detecting groups of similar visitors in a webpage.
- Anomaly detection and novelty detection: Detecting fraud or unusual use of a credit card.
- Visualization and dimensionality reduction: Identify unsuspected patterns in data or simplify a lot of information without losing quality.
- Association rule learning: Helps in discovering realations between attributes.

Say we have a robot, what type of algorithm would help in order to allow it to walk in various terrains? - **Reinforcement Learning**, this type of learning let machines to create the best strategies to maximize the rewards of their behavior.

### What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?

### Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning prob‐ lem or an unsupervised learning problem?

### What is an online learning system?

### What is out-of-core learning?

### What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predic‐ tions?

### What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithm’s hyperparameter?

### What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?

### Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?

### If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is ### happening? Can you name three possible solutions?

### What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?

### What is the purpose of a validation set?

### What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?

### What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?

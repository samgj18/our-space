## I got a job

The end.

To make a recap, I graduated in Electronic Engineering at the beginning of 2020. Immediately after, I started studying in an academy that, as Cervantes would say, _"name of which I have no desire to call to mind."_ I finished the academy by November 2020 and started an Embedded Systems Master Degree at Freiburg University. In the meantime, I was applying for jobs everywhere. I really wanted a taste of what getting in the mud felt like. After looking for a long time, I finally got a job in a Chilean company called Morris & Opazo. But, I couldn't take it; the stress of university and my desire to perform well in work were definitely not a good fit.

**After two months I quit.**

I started thinking that perhaps I should've waited, finish my studies and then look for a job. But reality checked, that "academy," _"the name of which I have no desire to call to mind,"_ started exerting pressure to pay an unfairly and leonine [ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement). So I had no choice but to start looking again.

I applied to companies untiringly, I turned into a serial applicant, you could say. But, nevertheless, I kept studying, doing projects to add to my resume, and got my **studienleitung** (which is basically approval for making the semester's final exams). Then, a month before finishing my semester, I received a call from a Talent Recruiter of [Torre](https://torre.co):

> *Samuel*, she said. *We're looking for Senior Software Engineers to build the next best platform for jobs, are you in?*

Don't remember why but I do remember that I was too stressed to care at the moment. So I said yes with no hope nor interest in the offer. That weekend I sat down and made the test the sent the last reasonable effort, I thought.

**Two weeks later, on December 24... they called me...**

I've been working in Torre as an SWE for four months now. What a challenging experience, what a journey has been to get a job this good at these uncertain times.

If you're out there reading this and see yourself in the mirror, thinking that there's no space for you in Tech Industry, do not despair. Instead, keep pushing and keep learning.

All those hours invested will soon pay off.


**PS: The name of the academy is Holberton School. Do not register, nor apply. I didn't learn anything new and felt like it was a waste of time.**

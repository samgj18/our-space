## I got a job

The end.

To make a recap I graduated as an Electronic Engineer at the beginning of last year. Immediately after I started studying in an academy that as Cervantes would say *"name of which I have no desire to call to mind"*. 
I finished the academy by November 2020 and started an Embedded Systems Master Degree in Freiburg University. In the meantime I was applying to jobs all over the place, I really wanted a taste of what *getting in the mud* felt like.
After looking for a long time I finally got a job in a Chilean company called Morris & Opazo. Couldn't take it, the stress of University plus my desire to perform well in work were definitely not a good fit.

**After two months I quit.**

I started thinking that perhaps I should've wait, finish my studies and then look for a job. But reality checked, that "academy" *"the name of which I have no desire to call to mind"*, started exerting pressure to pay an unfairly and leonine  (reasons why I believe it will be in the following post) [ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement) and I had no choice but to start looking again.

I applied to companies untiringly, I turned into a serial applicant, you could say. I kept studying, doing projects to add to my resume, and also got my **studienleitung** (which is basically approval for making the final exams of the semester). A month prior to finishing my semester I received a call from a Talent Recruiter of [Torre](https://torre.co):
> *Samuel*, she said. *We're looking for Senior Software Engineers to build the next best platform for jobs, are you in?*

Don't remember why but I do remember that I was too stressed to care at the moment. I said yes with no hope nor interest on the offer. That weekend I sat down and made the test the sent, the last good effort, I thought.

**Two weeks later, in December 24... they called me...**

I've been working in Torre as a SWE for four months now, what a challenging experience, what a journey has been to get a job this good at this uncertain times.

If you're out there reading this and see yourself in the mirror, thinking that there's no space for you in Tech Industry, do not despair. Keep pushing and keep learning.

All those hours invested will soon pay off.


**PS: Name of the academy is Holberton School. Do not register, nor apply. I didn't learn anything new and felt like it was a waste of time.**
